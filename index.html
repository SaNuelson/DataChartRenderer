    <h2>
        CSV2GC - Data Chart Renderer
    </h2>

    <p>
        Data Chart Renderer (DCR) is a jQuery plugin that allows you to easily render charts using raw data as an input along with options. <br />
        The plugin is divided into multiple layers. Depending on your needs, you can include specific subset of the plugin to suit your needs. <br />
        Here are a few examples, each using a specific layer's functionality to give you an idea how the plugin can be used: <br />
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            You can set up options for a specific chart
            <a href="web/config-page/index.html">here</a>. <br/>
            Afterwards, you can use the options saved as JSON for quick render as shown
            <a href="web/test-page/index.html">here</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
            You can instead give the user full (or partial) control over the options as shown
            <a href="example-uigen/index.html">here</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
            Alternative test using Chart.js <a href="chartjs/index.html">here</a>.
        </li>
    </ul>
