allowHtml	
If set to true, any annotation text that includes HTML tags will be rendered as HTML.

Type: boolean
Default: false
allValuesSuffix	
A suffix to be added to all values in the legend and tick labels in the vertical axes.

Type: string
Default: none
annotationsWidth	
The width (in percent) of the annotations area, out of the entire chart area. Must be a number in the range 5-80.

Type: number
Default: 25
colors	
The colors to use for the chart lines and labels. An array of strings. Each element is a string in a valid HTML color format. For example 'red' or '#00cc00'.

Type: Array of strings
Default: Default colors
dateFormat	
The format used to display the date information in the top right corner. The format of this field is as specified by the java SimpleDateFormat class.

Type: string
Default: Either 'MMMM dd, yyyy' or 'HH:mm MMMM dd, yyyy', depending on the type of the first column (date, or datetime, respectively).
displayAnnotations	
If set to false, the chart will hide the annotations table, and the annotations and annotationText will not be visible (the annotations table will also not be displayed if there are no annotations in your data, regardless of this option). When this option is set to true, after every numeric column, two optional annotation string columns can be added, one for the annotation title and one for the annotation text.

Type: boolean
Default: true
displayAnnotationsFilter	
If set to true, the chart will display a filter control to filter annotations. Use this option when there are many annotations.

Type: boolean
Default: false
displayDateBarSeparator	
Whether to display a small bar separator ( | ) between the series values and the date in the legend, where true means yes.

Type: boolean
Default: true
displayExactValues	
Whether to display a shortened, rounded version of the values on the top of the graph, to save space; false indicates that it may. For example, if set to false, 56123.45 might be displayed as 56.12k.

Type: boolean
Default: false
displayLegendDots	
Whether to display dots next to the values in the legend text, where true means yes.

Type: boolean
Default: true
displayLegendValues	
Whether to display the highlighted values in the legend, where true means yes.

Type: boolean
Default: true
displayRangeSelector	
Whether to show the zoom range selection area (the area at the bottom of the chart), where false means no.

The outline in the zoom selector is a log scale version of the first series in the chart, scaled to fit the height of the zoom selector.

Type: boolean
Default: true
displayZoomButtons	
Whether to show the zoom buttons ("1d 5d 1m" and so on), where false means no.

Type: boolean
Default: true
fill	
A number from 0—100 (inclusive) specifying the alpha of the fill below each line in the line graph. 100 means 100% opaque, and 0 means no fill at all. The fill color is the same color as the line above it.

Type: number
Default: 0
legendPosition	
Whether to put the colored legend on the same row with the zoom buttons and the date ('sameRow'), or on a new row ('newRow').

Type: string
Default: 'sameRow'
max	
The maximum value to show on the Y axis. If the maximum data point exceeds this value, this setting will be ignored, and the chart will be adjusted to show the next major tick mark above the maximum data point. This will take precedence over the Y axis maximum determined by scaleType.

This is similar to maxValue in core charts.

Type: number
Default: automatic
min	
The minimum value to show on the Y axis. If the minimum data point is less than this value, this setting will be ignored, and the chart will be adjusted to show the next major tick mark below the minimum data point. This will take precedence over the Y axis minimum determined by scaleType.

This is similar to minValue in core charts.

Type: number
Default: automatic
numberFormats	
Specifies the number format patterns to be used to format the values at the top of the graph.

The patterns should be in the format as specified by the java DecimalFormat class.

If not specified, the default format pattern is used.
If a single string pattern is specified, it is used for all of the values.
If a map is specified, the keys are (zero-based) indexes of series, and the values are the patterns to be used to format the specified series.

You are not required to include a format for every series on the chart; any unspecified series will use the default format.

If this option is specified, the displayExactValues option is ignored.

Type: String, or a map of number:String pairs
Default: automatic
scaleColumns	
Specifies which values to show on the Y axis tick marks in the graph. The default is to have a single scale on the right side, which applies to both series; but you can have different sides of the graph scaled to different series values.

This option takes an array of zero to three numbers specifying the (zero-based) index of the series to use as the scale value. Where these values are shown depends on how many values you include in your array:

If you specify an empty array, the chart will not show Y values next to the tick marks.
If you specify one value, the scale of the indicated series will be displayed on the right side of the chart only.
If you specify two values, a the scale for the second series will be added to the right of the chart.
If you specify three values, a scale for the third series will be added to the middle of the chart.
Any values after the third in the array will be ignored.
When displaying more than one scale, it is advisable to set the scaleType option to either 'allfixed' or 'allmaximized'.

Type: Array of numbers
Default: Automatic
scaleFormat	
Number format to be used for the axis tick labels. The default of '#' displays as an integer.

Type: string
Default: '#'
scaleType	
Sets the maximum and minimum values shown on the Y axis. The following options are available:

'maximized' - The Y axis will span the minimum to the maximum values of the series. If you have more than one series, use allmaximized.
'fixed' [default] - The Y axis varies, depending on the data values values:
If all values are >=0, the Y axis will span from zero to the maximum data value.
If all values are <=0, the Y axis will span from zero to the minimum data value.
If values are both positive and negative, the Y axis will range from the series maximum to the series minimum.
For multiple series, use 'allfixed'.
'allmaximized' - Same as 'maximized,' but used when multiple scales are displayed. Both charts will be maximized within the same scale, which means that one will be misrepresented against the Y axis, but hovering over each series will display its true value.
'allfixed' - Same as 'fixed,' but used when multiple scales are displayed. This setting adjusts each scale to the series to which it applies (use this in conjunction with scaleColumns).
If you specify the min and/or max options, they will take precedence over the minimum and maximum values determined by your scale type.

Type: string
Default: 'fixed'
table	
Contains options relating to the annotations table. To specify properties of this object, you can use object literal notation:

var options: {
  table: {
    sortAscending: true,
    sortColumn: 1
  }
};
      
Type: object
Default: null
table.sortAscending	
If set to true, reverses the order of the annotations table and displays them in ascending order.

Type: boolean
Default: false
table.sortColumn	
The column index of the annotations table for which the annotations will be sorted. The index must be either 0, for the annotation label column, or 1, for the annotation text column.

Type: number
Default: 0
thickness	
A number from 0—10 (inclusive) specifying the thickness of the lines, where 0 is the thinnest.

Type: number
Default: 0
zoomEndTime	
Sets the end date/time of the selected zoom range.

Type: Date
Default: none
zoomStartTime	
Sets the start date/time of the selected zoom range.

Type: Date
Default: none
