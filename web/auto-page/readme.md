DCR SHARD stand-alone web-page
===

This web-page uses the DCR SHARD module to visualize potential charts from a provided dataset.

You can provide datasets either by URL or local machine. A set of demo datasets is also available.

Upon selecting a dataset, the processing will parse the incoming data, and try to infer its schema by analyzing individual columns.

Finally, a set of potential charts will be rendered. Additionally, some of the gathered information will also be shown.
